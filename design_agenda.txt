*  Mining implementation- creating smelters and openings on the surface?
*  Actor portraits, full names, and more attention to skins/costumes.
*  Farming implementation-
  Need to have a central hub for creating nurseries, and grab areas to
  cultivate intelligently.  May need to use a mipmap for pathing/reservation.
  Also need to prioritise different types of crops, for starches/greens/protein
  or forestry.  Consider having crops extend flora.
  Also, look into condensors and windtraps/solar arrays.

What are the tradeoffs involved in this game?
  The packing problem of placement of services and infrastructure while
  accomodating aura structures.
  The personnel you choose to recruit, their personalities, and which missions
  you send them on at what times.
  The schools you invest in and large-scale politics, which become an
  increasingly binding commitment.
